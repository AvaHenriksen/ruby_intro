# Nouns, Verbs, and Grammar

When we program, we generally have some **data** (or information) that's important to us; and we want to do something useful with it.

Let's consider a computer that you already know how to program:

When we're using (or programming) a calculator, our data are numbers and we want to tell the processor to add, subtract, multiply, and perform other calculations on them.

When we write an expression in the calculator language, we need to put together **data** and **instructions** in an order that makes sense; for example, if we press the keys <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>×</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> in that sequence, we will see the intended output in the screen.

We refer to "an order that makes sense" as the language's **syntax**, or grammar. In the calculator language, <kbd>×</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> would not be valid syntax.

A basic calculator's entire programming language vocabulary consists of the following:

**Data**

<kbd>1</kbd>
<kbd>2</kbd>
<kbd>3</kbd>
<kbd>4</kbd>
<kbd>5</kbd>
<kbd>6</kbd>
<kbd>7</kbd>
<kbd>8</kbd>
<kbd>9</kbd>
<kbd>0</kbd>
<kbd>.</kbd>

**Instructions**

<kbd>=</kbd>
<kbd>+</kbd>
<kbd>-</kbd>
<kbd>×</kbd>
<kbd>÷</kbd>
<kbd>%</kbd>
<kbd>±</kbd>
<kbd>AC</kbd>

and there's only one valid **syntax**, which looks like <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>×</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd>.

It's a very small language, but it demonstrates the same parts as any other programming language: **data**, **instructions**, and **syntax**.

I think of them as **nouns**, **verbs**, and **grammar**. For each language we want to learn, we just have to learn what **things** we can work with, what we can **do** with those things, and how to put together valid **sentences** to tell the processor to do them.

## HTML

Let's consider a slightly more complicated language that you already know: HTML.

What kind of data do we work with in HTML?

What kind of instructions do we give the processor (the browser) to handle our data?
